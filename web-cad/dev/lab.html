<body onresize="showCoord()">  
  
  
  HTML elements on most browsers will have:-

offsetLeft
offsetTop
These specifiy the position of the element relative its nearest parent that has layout. This parent can often be accessed bif the offsetParent property.

IE and FF3 have

clientLeft
clientTop
These properties are less common, they specify an elements position with its parents client area (padded area is part of the client area but border and margin is not).

You might be better served by using a JavaScript framework, that has functions to return such information (and so much more!) in a browser-independant fashion. Here are a few:

Prototype
jQuery
MooTools
YUI (yahoo)
With these frameworks, you could do something like: $('id-of-img').top to get the y-pixel co
  <div id='w' style="background:#0CC;width:300px;height:300px"></div>
   
</body>

<script type="text/javascript">
function showCoord(){
	var w=document.getElementById('w');
	w.innerHTML='offsetTop:'+w.offsetTop;
}

</script>

</html>
